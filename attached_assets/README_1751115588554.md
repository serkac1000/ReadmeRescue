# Voice-Controlled Video Cutter

# Voice-Controlled Video Cutter (GUI Edition)

This Python application provides a graphical user interface (GUI) to cut `.mp4` video files using simple voice commands. It features an integrated video player to preview your selected file.

## Prerequisites

*   **Python 3:** Download from [python.org](https://python.org/downloads/). During installation, make sure to check the box that says **"Add Python to PATH"**.
*   **FFmpeg:** A powerful, free tool for video manipulation.

## Quick Setup & Run (Recommended)

1.  **Install FFmpeg:**
    *   Use the `install_ffmpeg.ps1` PowerShell script (see instructions below) or install it manually to `C:\ffmpeg`.

2.  **Run the Installer Batch File:**
    *   Simply double-click the `install_and_run.bat` file.
    *   This will automatically install the necessary Python libraries (including the new video player) and launch the application.

## How to Use the Application

1.  Run `install_and_run.bat` or execute `python main.py` in your terminal.
2.  Click the **"Select Video File"** button to choose the `.mp4` file you want to edit. The video will load and start playing in the window.
3.  Use the timeline on the video player to find the exact start and end times you want to cut.
4.  Click the **"Click to Give Voice Command"** button and speak your command clearly.

## Voice Commands

The application window displays the list of available commands.

### Step 1: Define the Cut

*   **Command:** `"Cut from [start time] to [end time]"`
*   **Example:** `"Cut from 15 seconds to 40 seconds"` or `"Cut from 1 minute to 2 minutes 10 seconds"`
*   **Action:** After this command, the video will seek to the start time and play the selected segment as a preview. The cut is now defined but not yet saved.

### Step 2: Save the File

*   **Command:** `"Save with name [your desired filename]"`
*   **Example:** `"Save with name my_new_clip"`
*   **Action:** This saves the previously defined cut to a new file named `my_new_clip.mp4` in the same directory as the original video.

### Other Commands

*   **Exit:** Say `"exit"` to close the application.
