========================================
VOICE VIDEO CUTTER - WINDOWS TEST PACKAGE
========================================

QUICK START FOR TESTING:
========================

1. INSTALL PYTHON (if not already installed):
   - Download from: https://python.org/downloads/
   - IMPORTANT: Check "Add Python to PATH" during installation
   - Verify: Open Command Prompt and type "python --version"

2. INSTALL FFMPEG:
   - Right-click on "install_ffmpeg.ps1"
   - Select "Run with PowerShell"
   - May require administrator privileges

3. RUN THE APPLICATION:
   - Double-click "install_and_run.bat"
   - This will automatically install dependencies and start the app

ALTERNATIVE INSTALLATION:
========================

If the automatic installation doesn't work:

1. Open Command Prompt in this folder
2. Run: pip install -r requirements.txt
3. If speech recognition fails, run: install_pyaudio.bat
4. Run: python main.py

TESTING CHECKLIST:
==================

□ Application starts without errors
□ Can select a video file
□ Manual input works (start/end times)
□ Can cut video using manual input
□ Voice commands work (if PyAudio installed)
□ FFmpeg processes video correctly
□ Output files are created successfully

EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
==================

✓ Application should start with GUI interface
✓ Manual input should always work
✓ Video preview may show "not available" - this is normal
✓ Voice commands may not work if PyAudio fails - manual input is the fallback
✓ FFmpeg is required for actual video processing

TROUBLESHOOTING:
===============

- If "Python not found": Reinstall Python with PATH option checked
- If "FFmpeg not found": Run install_ffmpeg.ps1 as administrator
- If "Speech not available": Run fix_speech_recognition.py for guided fix
- If app crashes: Check that video file is valid format (MP4, AVI, etc.)

FILES INCLUDED:
===============

main.py                    - Main application
requirements.txt           - Python dependencies
install_and_run.bat       - Automated setup script
install_ffmpeg.ps1        - FFmpeg installer
install_pyaudio.bat       - PyAudio installer
fix_speech_recognition.py - Speech recognition troubleshooter
setup.py                  - Package setup script
README.md                 - Full documentation

SUPPORT:
========

For issues during testing, check:
1. Python version (3.7+ required)
2. FFmpeg installation
3. Video file format compatibility
4. Available disk space for output files

The application is designed to work even if some features fail.
Manual input should always be functional for basic video cutting.
