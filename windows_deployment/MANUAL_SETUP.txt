MANUAL SETUP GUIDE
==================

If the automatic scripts don't work, follow these manual steps:

STEP 1: Open Command Prompt
---------------------------
1. Press Windows + R
2. Type "cmd" and press Enter
3. Navigate to the folder where you extracted the files:
   cd "C:\path\to\your\extracted\folder"

STEP 2: Find Your Python
-------------------------
Try these commands one by one until one works:

python --version
C:\Users\serka\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python312\python.exe --version
%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python312\python.exe --version

Once you find the working Python command, use it for the next steps.

STEP 3: Install Dependencies
-----------------------------
Replace "python" with your working Python command:

python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install Flask Werkzeug SpeechRecognition
python -m pip install pyaudio

(If pyaudio fails, that's okay - voice recognition just won't work)

STEP 4: Install FFmpeg
-----------------------
Download from: https://ffmpeg.org/download.html
Extract to C:\ffmpeg and add C:\ffmpeg\bin to your PATH

STEP 5: Start the Application
-----------------------------
python app.py

Then open your browser to: http://localhost:5000

TROUBLESHOOTING
===============

Virtual Environment Error:
If you see "venv\Scripts\activate: command not found":
- You're in Git Bash, use Command Prompt instead
- Or use: source venv/Scripts/activate (with forward slashes)

Python Not Found:
- Make sure Python is installed
- Check the exact path in File Explorer
- Use the full path instead of just "python"

Port Already in Use:
- Close any other running instances
- Or change the port in app.py (line with port=5000)
